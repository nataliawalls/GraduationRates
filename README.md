# GraduationRates

#Description
There are many different people who attend college in the United States. People of all different races, genders, and backgrounds attend college. This begs the question “What factors affect graduation statistics?” How do things like race, gender, state, and major impact graduation rates? With our data from several thousand US schools, could there be some trend or relationship between graduation rates and these factors?

#This overarching question was the driving force for our team's investigation. However, we really dug into a few things. One of the things we focused on was graduation rates by state. Another thing we looked into was if gender played any role as well. Lastly, we looked at majors to see if there were any strong correlations or findings there that affected graduation.

#here is a graph showing the affects that gender has depending on the major someone would go into.
